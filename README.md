### 🚀 Installation & Setup
#### 1. Install required packages:
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn streamlit joblib

#### 2. Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run demo.py


### 🔬 Methodology
#### 1. Data Preprocessing
* Handled ~5% missing values in key columns

* Removed ~2% duplicate records

* Encoded categorical variables (category, device, country)

* Created new feature: engagement_rate = (likes + comments) / views

#### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
* Comprehensive statistical analysis

* Correlation analysis between features

* Distribution analysis of target variable

* Outlier detection and handling

#### 3. Model Building & Evaluation
Tested 5 different regression models:

|**Model**	       | **R² Score** |**RMSE**	| **MAE** |
| -----------      | ----------   |---------|---------|
|Lasso Regression	 | 0.9526	      |   13.47	|  3.12   |
|Ridge Regression	 | 0.9526	      |   13.48	|  3.12   |
|Linear Regression | 0.9526	      |   13.48	|  3.12   |
|Random Forest	   | 0.9521	      |   13.55	|  3.70   |
|Gradient Boosting | 0.9518	      |   13.58	|  4.07   |


#### 4. Model Selection
Lasso Regression was selected as the best model based on:

Highest R² score (0.9526)

Lowest RMSE (13.47)

Built-in feature selection capability

Good generalization performance


### 💻 Streamlit App Features
